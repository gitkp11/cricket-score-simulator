ABSTRACT:
      •	SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENT:
        -DEV-C++ editor & compiler, 
        -IDE for CPP program
        -2 GB ram, i5 Core
      •	PLATFORM USED: C++ 
      •	INTRODUCTION:
       We have created a cricket scorecard simulator program which simulates
       a cricket match and then displays the output on the desired screen.
       Various OOP techniques and Data structures were used like
       -Abstraction
       -Inheritance
       -Encapsulation
       -Polymorphism
       -File Handling
       -Function Overloading
      •	ALGORITHM:
       -Step 1: Start
       -Step 2: take the input (difficulty of cricket match)
       -Step 1: take the second input (no of overs of match)
       -Step 1:
       -Step 1:
       -Step 1:
      •	FUTURE SCOPE
        In future we can apply Graphical user interface to our algorithm and 
        then we can create a user-friendly cricket game which plays automatically 
        (can modify for manual play as well).
        We can then apply Artificial Intelligence to it to acquire real time 
        location scenario to adjust according to the surrounding and generate 
        the score according to the recent trend.
